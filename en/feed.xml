&lt;h3 id=&quot;feedbacks--in-real-time-please&quot;&gt;Feedbacks ! (in real time please)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/aes_results1_EN.png&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; alt=&quot;drawing&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot; /&gt;
More than 430 feedbacks were received, thanks to our Roti.express platform, which measured the satisfaction rate of the sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were here all day long, and observed in real time the feedbacks arrive on the platform. At the exit of the rooms the speakers came to find us to know their “score” in preview!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average score is 4.12/5, with an outstanding score of 4.91 for the inspiring talk of Virginie Guyot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These feedbacks are shared with the speakers and participants in a mindset of continuous improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://roti.express/feedback/aes2018&quot;&gt; Watch the full results Agile en Seine 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note : these results are in French, use the google translator if you want them in English !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-did-it-work-pretty-well&quot;&gt;Why did it work pretty well?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking feedback is always a tricky moment and can be really time-consuming, both for capture and analysis if it is poorly done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We announced that this will take place at the Keynote session and we quickly explained the rules of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To answer: no app to download, no tedious registration (login/password). I flash, I answer, and that’s it!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We did not force anyone to answer! And we were clear: “it’s not your data that interests us but your feedback on the event”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We explained that the final results would be shared with everyone. Besides, we were already ready before the end of the event!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taking feeback with the ROTI method (in Agile mode) was very suitable for this event!

  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;capturing-feedback-during-an-event&quot;&gt;Capturing feedback during an event?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We asked the speakers to put a giant QR-Code on the last slide of their Powerpoint presentation
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/aes_feedback1.jpg&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; alt=&quot;drawing&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for those who did not have time to flash the code we made posters in A3 format for each of the sessions, we put them on the doors of each conference room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have installed a “QR-Code Wall” in the corridor that connects the different rooms!

&lt;p&gt;Summer 2017, I am consultant in a mission for a client who starts a digital transformation, big project over 2 years, critical and strategic for the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s 14:00 am I attend my first “weekly meeting”, I’m not the animator but a simple participants, let’s start !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there I experienced the worst meeting of my life, everything went wrong:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;14 people were invited: physical &amp;amp; online with skype&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;some participants were (very) late&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;there was no agenda&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;some topics without any relation to the meeting were discussed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;no output / todo-list&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I thought I touched the bottom when I realized one of the participants allowed himself to answer his phone during the meeting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watch the disaster, and suddenly the little Agile coach that sleeps inside me says :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“at the end of the meeting it is ** mandatory ** to get feedbacks from the participants and make sure that this nightmare does not repeat next week”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this moment I am thinking of ROTI (Return On Time Invested), this easy and quick ceremony that allows you to quickly assess the satisfaction with the meeting and get some area of improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;frustration&quot;&gt;Frustration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started late, and of course we finished late, the clock is running, the room is reserved, the participants have other meetings that are already starting, the Skype participants are disconnecting … no more time to do the Roti, I am alone as a fool with my idea of taking feedback, I feel hopeless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went home terribly frustrated and on the way back (in the subway) I decided:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“It does not matter, I could not do it live but I’ll do it offline, I have the email addresses of everyone and I intend to ask them for feedback by e-mail”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spend a good part of my evening looking for a tool that would simply ask my two questions to participants:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On a scale of 1 to 5 how would you rate the time spent on this meeting?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What could be improved for next time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/ok_google.png&quot; alt=&quot;drawing&quot; width=&quot;85%&quot; /&gt;
After reviewing what Google offers and various survey tools I ended up realizing that there was no tool that would answer simply to my need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creation&quot;&gt;Creation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, next steps came quickly! It is 21:00 I contact Guillaume (the other co-founder) by phone, I explain my problems of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideas are spinning in our heads, it’s no longer just a feedback tool that we think about, but an online platform that allows companies to do ROTI surveys in seconds, track their progress over time, identify quickly a meeting that goes wrong : continuous improvement applied to meetings!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The machine is on track, the following days I wake up at 5am to draw the screens, Guillaume writes the first lines of codes, we decide on a name “roti.express” and choose a nice logo !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prototype, MVP, cloud architecture, field tests, scalability, acceleration at Station F! … But all this is another story, see you in the next article!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s nice to see you here! In September 2017, a year ago, we designed the first screens and wrote the first lines of code of our Roti.express application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Since last year many things happened and we decided to launch this blog to tell you about our adventures! Come back soon, you will not be disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime we invite you to watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_E4HGfBCpQ&quot;&gt;a small video of 59 seconds&lt;/a&gt; that explains what Roti.express is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you already know what it is, &lt;a href=&quot;https://roti.express/start&quot;&gt;just start your first survey&lt;/a&gt; for your events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you soon.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Guillaume Darbonne</name></author><category term="Hello World !" /><summary type="html">Hello and welcome to our blog.</summary></entry></feed>
